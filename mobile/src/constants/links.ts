/**
 * Outward-facing contact and legal links.

 * SUPPORT_EMAIL and SUPPORT_PHONE are only the offline fallback now — the live
 * values come from `app_settings` via useAppSettings(), so support contacts can
 * change from the admin panel without a store release. Screens should read the
 * hook; these are what renders before the first response arrives.
 *
 * The legal document URLs used to live here. They now come from app_settings
 * (privacy_url / terms_url) so they can be published without a release --
 * see useAppSettings(). The screens still show an honest "not published yet"
 * state while those are null, rather than inventing legal copy.
